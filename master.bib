abstract = "Abstract A cosmic-ray veto shield for the University of Notre Dame neutron wall has been constructed in order to carry out low-rate neutron time-of-flight (TOF) measurements. The veto detector employs plastic scintillator embedded with wavelength-shifting fibers and is read out by a versatile coupling to standard photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). This veto shield is effective at reducing the muon background by about one order of magnitude and therefore increases the sensitivity for experiments with low neutron yields. The 26Mg(3He,n)28Si reaction was used as a testbed for the veto. "

        reaction for near-barrier projectile center-of-mass energies of 23.9 to
   43.0 MeV using the ISAC2 facility at TRIUMF. The alpha-emitting
       evaporation residues ((211-214)At) were stopped in the (208)Pb target,
          and their decay was measured. The isotopic yields at each energy were in
    good agreement with the predictions of a statistical model code (HIVAP).
        The measured fusion excitation function shows evidence for substantial
   sub-barrier fusion enhancement not predicted by current theoretical
	      models. There is a suppression of the above barrier cross sections
	         relative to these model predictions. The implications of this
		    measurement for studying the fusion of (11)Li with (208)Pb are
       discussed.}},

  Abstract = {{As hindrance sets in for the fusion of heavier systems, the effect of large neutron excess in the colliding nuclei on their probability to fuse is still an open question. The detection of evaporation residues (ERs), however, provides indisputable evidence for the fusion (complete and incomplete) in the reaction. We therefore devised a system with which we could measure ERs using low intensity neutron-rich radioactive ion beams with an efficiency close to 100\%. We report on measurements of the production of ERs in collisions of (132,134)Sn, (134)Te and (134)Sb ion beams with medium mass, neutron-rich targets. The data taken with (131,134)Sn bombarding a (64)Ni target are compared to available data (ERs and fusion) taken with stable Sri isotopes. Preliminary data on the fusion of (132)Sn with (96)Zr target are also presented.}},
